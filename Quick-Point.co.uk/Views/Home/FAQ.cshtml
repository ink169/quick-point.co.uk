                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>My employees are unwell with a diagnosed case of Covid-19. Do I have to pay them?</h3>If your employees are unwell with or have symptoms of Covid-19, they are entitled to receive usual sick leave.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>My employees have Covid-19 symptoms but have not been diagnosed yet. Do I have to pay them?</h3>If your employees are unwell with or have symptoms of Covid-19, they are entitled to receive usual sick leave.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can I stop Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for my employees?</h3>For Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) purposes, employers and employees can agree to end a period of incapacity for work in order to stop SSP and commence furlough leave instead.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can the period of incapacity for SSP purposes be ended if furlough is commenced?</h3>If your employees are unwell with or have symptoms of Covid-19, they are entitled to receive usual sick leave.</div>

                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What if my employee has contractual sick pay benefits?</h3>Employers that offer more generous contractual sick pay benefits, however, should consider whether they will provide sick pay at the usual contractual rate to those self-isolating.</div>

                            <h3>Terms of Employment</h3>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can employees take me to Court if I make them redundant during Covid-19 ourbreak?</h3>Only employees with two years' continious service are protected from unfair dismissal. A dismissal is unfair unless a) it was for a potentially fair reason listed in the legislation; and b) it was fair in the circumstances. Redundancy is potentially fair reason for dismissal. Redundancy occurs if there is closure of the business, for example. However, it is still unclear whether it will be considered fair when Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is in place</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What are the alternative options to redundancy?</h3>Changing terms and conditions, changing pension scheme, lay-off and short time working, reducing use of contract workers, discreitonary benefits, re-deployment, secondment, freezing recruitment or flexible working.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What are the main options for changing terms and conditions?</h3>Making changes which are allowed under the contract, varation by mutual agreement, unilateral imposition of new terms or terminating employees' contracts and re-engaging them on new terms.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>How can I vary the contractual terms and conditions?</h3>If the contract includes a 'flexibility clause', this would provide an expressed right to implement any changes. Depending on the clause, it may be a specific clause which covers the proposed change or it may give general power to vary the contract. However, flexibility clause may be restricted due to being ambiguous.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>How can I vary terms and conditions if there are no rights to impose unilateral changes?</h3>The best route is to obtain employees’ consent. Faced with the option of agreeing detrimental changes or potentially being made redundant, many employees are likely to be amenable albeit reluctantly.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What should I do if my employee refuses to agree to the required change of terms and conditions?</h3>You may announce that the change will be implemented from a set date. Although this may be a risky strategy as the employees may continue to work but under protest and reserve the right to sue for breach of contract, or resign and claim constructive dismissal.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Is there a legal duty for collective consultation purposes?</h3>Yes, if 20 or more employees will be dismissed within a 90-day period, you must consult with the recognised trade union if there is one, or elected employee representatives otherwise.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>How long shoud consultation period last?</h3>	The consultation period must last at least 60 days to allow consulting with employee representatives.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Is there any statutory protection of lay-off or short-time working available to my employee?</h3>Yes, but it is complex and little-used in practice. It provides a right for employees who have been laid off or kept on short time for four or more consecutive weeks or six weeks in any 13-week period to claim a redundancy payment in certain circumstances. The scheme only applies where the contract of employment allows for lay-off/short-time working without pay.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can my employee claim any compensation if they are laid-off without pay?</h3>There is a statutory wage protection scheme, where the employee can claim guarantee payment for the days which they would normally be required to work. However, there is a cap of £29.00 per day and entitlement is limited only to five days in any three month period.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What should I do if my employee does not consent to flexible working?</h3>	You can seek to rely on any flexibility clauses in the contract or consider terminating and re-engaging on new terms as a final resort.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>What if my employee holds Tier 2 or Tier 5 Visa?</h3>Any of the employees who hold a Tier 2 or 5 visa will have reporting requirements that are likely to be triggered in case of redundancy or decising to lay-off, which may then have knock-on implications for whether they can keep their visa or not.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can employers require employees to take or not to take holiday?</h3>	It will depend on whether the holiday is statutory or contractual. Statutory holiday is covered by the Working Time Regulations 1998 and allows the employer to request its employees to take holiday during a specific period as long as employer gives twice as much advance notice as the amount of holiday. Conditions of contractual holiday will depend on the terms of the contract or internal holiday policy.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can employees carry-over their unused leave?</h3>Yes, the employees are allowed to carry forward the four weeks of leave guaranteed under the European Working Time Directive, where it was not reasonably practicable to take holiday in the current leave year, such as a result of the effect of the coronavirus. The unused leave must be taken within the next two leave years.</div>
                            <div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Can employers delay the employee’s start date or withdraw a job offer?</h3>Employers are committed to the employment terms once a job offer was accepted by the employee. However, the employer can negotiate a new start date with its employee. If the individual is no longer required, the employer can dismiss the employee with less than two years’ service provided the dismissal is not in connection with discrimination or whistleblowing.</div>
