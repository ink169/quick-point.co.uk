It provides a right for employees who have been laid off or kept on short time for four or more consecutive weeks or six weeks in any 13-week period to claim a redundancy payment in certain circumstances. The scheme only applies where the contract of employment allows for lay-off/short-time working without pay.</div></li>

                                        You do not have to pay the grant back but it will be taxable. Only businesses which make an overall profit once grant income is included will be subject to tax.

                                        HMRC uses the information you or your tax agent or adviser sent on your Self Assessment tax returns to work out your grant amount. If you think the grant amount is too low, you should check how much you’ll get or contact your tax agent or adviser for help. If you still think the grant amount is too low, you or your agent can ask HMRC to review your grant amount.
                                        You or your agent will need:

                                        Your tax credits could go up, down or stop if there are changes in your family or work life.

                                        You must report any changes to your circumstances to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

                                        Do this as soon as possible to make sure you get the right amount of tax credits. You'll have to pay back the money if you're overpaid.

                                        If your tax credits stop, you can only make a new claim for tax credits if you get the severe disability premium or got it in the past month and are still eligible for it.

                                        If you're currently getting tax credits and you cannot work or you're working fewer hours because of coronavirus, you do not need to tell HMRC about this change as long as you're still employed or self-employed.
                                        You must still tell HMRC about other changes to your circumstances. This includes if you or your partner lose your job, are made redundant or cease trading.
