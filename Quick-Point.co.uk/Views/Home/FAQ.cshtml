In addition, the guidelines for restaurants also make specific suggestions for food preparation areas. The guidelines suggest limiting access to kitchens to as few people as possible and minimising interaction between kitchen staff and other workers, including when on breaks. Using one way traffic flows is suggested together with floor markings and keeping workstations two metres apart.

            <td>It will depend on whether the holiday is statutory or contractual. Statutory holiday is covered by the Working Time Regulations 1998 and allows the employer to request its employees to take holiday during a specific period as long as employer gives twice as much advance notice as the amount of holiday. Conditions of contractual holiday will depend on the terms of the contract or internal holiday policy.</td>
